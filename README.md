# MTA_data_EDA


In this project I am making reccomendations for food trucks on where to go in NYC. I am using MTA data as a proxy for foot traffic. I sampled a week out of each monntm. From January 2020 to April 2021. 


The file getandclean.ipynb was used to get the data and clean it. The file charts.ipynb has the analysis.
